# Breakout-2D is a game made by me that is based on the original Breakout game.

To play the game all you need is to access the site: https://maulem.itch.io/breakout-2d

The only controls are left and right arrows, the colored blocks give specials that can be good or bad, increasing or decreasing the ball speed or the size of the racket.

To win all you need is to destroy all the blocks
